- 👋 Hi, I’m @BubbaBeans
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of things.  I started programming in 1982 on a Commodore 64, and have picked up and toyed with a number of languages over the years,
and I'm horribly self-taught.  I love learning, and enjoy taking on little challenges that stretch my skills, but I still only program as a hobby.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to transition to C#.  I learned C++ in college, but that was a long time ago, and C# only seems to have some of the same fundamentals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting!  I can't say that my knowledge or skill-set is deep, but I'll do whatever I can
- 📫 How to reach me: http://scr.im/bubbabeans <-- from there you can send an email.  It's ok, it's safe!
